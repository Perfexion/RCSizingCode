This is the home directory for the RCSizingCode project

The ultimate goal of this code is to have a matlab function which can intelligently perform our RC sizing for us.

There are currently three branches withing git for this project, the master branch, the stable branch, and the dev branch. I will detail each branch:

Master Branch - 

	This branch is the main branch of the project. Only previous stable versions will be committed here. 

Stable Branch - 

	This branch will provide the most recent complete and working version of the code. This should be checked out when using the code for it's designed function but should not be used for editing. Only when the dev branch reaches a working and stable state should it be merged with this branch. 

Dev Branch -
	
	This branch is the branch which should be used for developement. Any new features will first be added here. The dev branch will also maintain a todo list which can be contributed to by anyone, and which those wishing to contribute to the code should look for tasks which need done in the code.



How to use git: 

To be honest I am still working out the details of git myself. I will write up a short section here on the simple commands for git once I get it mostly figured out myself.
