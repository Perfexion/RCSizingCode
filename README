This is the home directory for the RCSizingCode project

The ultimate goal of this code is to have a matlab function which can intelligently perform our RC sizing for us.

There are currently two branches withing git for this project, the master branch, and the dev branch.

Master Branch - 

	This branch is the main branch of the project. Only when a dev branch is deemed stable will it be committed here.  

Dev Branch -
	
	This branch is the branch which should be used for developement. Any new features will first be added here. The dev branch will also maintain a todo list which can be contributed to by anyone, and which those wishing to contribute to the code should look for tasks which need done in the code.
